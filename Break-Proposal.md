A Conference That Questions the Edges of Design
-----------------------------------------------

### 12-14 November, 2014

What is design and how is it changing? How are designers evolving as we move away from a world of design specialism that has, until very recently, been so prevalent? [Break](http://breakconf.org “Break: A Conference That Questions the Edges of Design”) is about breaking down boundaries, removing the artificial barriers that have somehow been erected to encircle the various ‘specialisms’ of design.

It explores how what we do as designers is changing to reflect an increasingly fluid and multidisciplinary form of making. Break is intended to challenge and to inspire. It’s designed to encourage you to look beyond your boundaries, to see further. Join us for an affordable day – with associated fringe events – that will, I hope, leave you feeling ready to conquer the world.



Ticket Price
------------

Though I very much enjoy week long festivals like [Build](http://buildconf.com) and [Brooklyn Beta](https://brooklynbeta.org/) (and I’m happy to have been to each and every one of these), not everyone can afford to take a week off work. Doing a festival properly, with all it entails, often puts it beyond many’s reach and I’d like to create something that freelancers and students can attend without breaking the bank.

With this in mind, I’m focusing around a core conference day, with optional unconference activities the preceding day. This keeps the costs down, ensuring the event is affordable. I’d also like to price student tickets affordably. As an educator, I think it’s important to put professionals and students together, I’d like to support that.

My goal is to pitch tickets for professionals at £120 with student tickets at £60. I’m not running this to make a profit. The bottom line, for me, is about community building and helping to keep Belfast on the map internationally, as – I believe – it rightly deserves to be.



Venue
-----

Built in 1905 as the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the [Assembly Buildings](http://www.assemblybuildings.co.uk) is one of the most impressive buildings in Belfast’s city centre.

It was recently restored at a cost of £8 million. I think it’s a beautiful space, with wonderful stained glass and gargoyles. It can accommodate ~1,000 people, however, I’m planning to limit numbers to ~400 to keep the feeling intimate. It has a wonderful church organ, which has been lovingly restored. The space has a real character, which is why I chose it. It’s hard to describe. The atmosphere, however, is warm and inviting.

### Wednesday

This is optional, pre-conference. ‘An Afternoon With Shopify’ is free and, following the success of my collaboration with Shopify at Build in 2013, will follow a similar format. The Shopify event will be followed by an early evening talk, titled ‘A Rather Large Tutorial’. The evening talk is designed to get you asking questions so that your brain is fully engaged for the main conference day.

Wednesday evening will consist of an open house, courtesy of the team at Typecast, followed by an informal pre-party.


#### An Afternoon With Shopify (13.00-17.00)

Working with Keir Whitaker, of [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com), we’ll once again run ‘An Afternoon with Shopify’ in Belfast. This was a big success when we ran it at Build 2013, and I’d like to build on that success and make it a core part of Break. This year we’ll be running it in The Black Box, one of the principal arts and entertainment venues in Belfast.

In short, we’ll enjoy an informative afternoon of pre-conference education and entertainment, compered by Shopify’s Keir Whitaker. We’ve secured a fantastic lineup of speakers to share their experience with attendees:

+ Elliot Jay Stocks (Creative Director, [Typekit](https://typekit.com))
+ Verne Ho (Director of Design, [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com))
+ Ryan Rumsey (Experience Design, [Nestlé](http://www.nestleinstitutehealthsciences.com))


#### A Rather Large Tutorial (17.00-18.00)

An early evening talk on the theme: ‘What happens when we ‘break’ design?’ This talk asks questions in advance of the following day’s speakers. It seeks to prime the brain beforehand.


#### Typecast Open House (Times TBC)

Belfast is rapidly establishing itself as a key player on a digital world stage. Andy McMillan’s sterling work with Build needs no introduction. The team at [Typecast](http://typecast.com) are taking the wonderful world of web typography to new heights. Cargo’s recently unveiled [Brewbot](http://www.brewbot.io) is rightly winning the praise it deserves (who wouldn’t want to, as Fast Company put it, “Brew beer with an iPhone?”). Belfast is firmly on the map, right where it deserves to be.

We’re delighted to be partnering with the team at Typecast to run a Typecast Open House with drinks and nibbles.


#### Pre-Party (Times TBC)

We’ll round out the night with a pre-party designed to continue the conversation. This is informal and will probably congregate around The Duke of York and The John Hewitt.


### Thursday

This is the main event. You could feasibly fly in for it, first thing in the morning, and leave right afterwards, but attending the pre- and after-parties is recommended. The conference will last the full day (09.00-18.00) and will be followed by a short break for attendees to get dinner. We’ll round out the day with an after-party, generously sponsored by MailChimp.


#### Conference

Our speakers span a wide spectrum of experience. All, in their own way, are teasing at the edges of design, investigating what it might be and what it might become.

In my mind speakers aren’t ‘web designers’ or ‘graphic designers’ or ‘product designers’ or, indeed, ‘insert-specialism-here designers’. They’re just designers, and even then, I use that term very, very loosely.

Confirmed speakers:

+ Sarah Richards ([Head of Content Design, GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk), [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk))
+ Nicolas Roope ([Hulger](http://www.hulger.com), [Plumen](http://plumen.com))
+ Hamish Muir ([8vo](http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/8vo), [Outcast Editions](http://www.outcasteditions.com))
+ Dan Rubin ([MOO](http://moo.com), [Webgraph](http://danrubin.is))
+ Jane ni Dhulchaointigh ([Sugru](http://sugru.com), [Fail Better](http://sugru.com))
+ Alex Klein ([Kano](http://www.kano.me), [Kano at Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexklein/kano-a-computer-anyone-can-make))
+ Adrian Shaughnessy ([Unit Editions](http://www.uniteditions.com), [Design Observer](http://designobserver.com))
+ Matt Webb ([BERG](http://bergcloud.com), [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/))

I’ve opened out the list of speakers so that they’re challenging and interesting. I think they are all looking beyond the silos of specialism. They should ask participants questions and leave them seeking answers.


#### After-Party

Every conference needs an afterparty and Break is no different. I don’t think an afterparty needs much explanation really: alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic beverages and lots of conversation. We’ve booked [21 Social](http://www.21social.co.uk) for our afterparty. I’m delighted that my friends at [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) are very kindly sponsoring this. I’ve always respected MailChimp’s ethos and I’m very happy to have the on board as sponsors.


### Friday

I imagine most people would want to head home on the Friday, but – if there were interest – I’d be happy to explore some informal Friday activities for attendees who wanted to see a little of Belfast, perhaps a visit to [Titanic Belfast](http://www.titanicbelfast.com) or simply some informal meetups.



Added Value
-----------

I’d like to give the attendees something special, some schwag, of course, but also a publication of some description. I envisage two, digital, books (ePub, PDF, mobi): one that explores design in a  wider context, called ‘At the Edges of Design’; a second that’s a properly researched and well-written Belfast Gazetteer, a guide for attendees that serves both the event and future visits to Belfast.


### Book(s)

I’d like there to be a book of some description, something substantive, with curated content contributed by guest writers (Adrian Shaughnessy, Richard Weston, Jonny Campbell and others…) and edited by Owen Gregory, who edits for Five Simple Steps and 24 Ways.

This could be a sponsored publication, something one off, that gives a different angle on the conference content. It would act as a memento of the event, but would also stand in its own right as a book to return to.

I’d be keen to find a sponsor who would be interested in backing a well-written publication that was properly curated with contributions by respected writers and that was properly edited and beautifully designed. I have a lot of ideas around what this might be, it would be wonderful to push the envelope on this.


### Lanyard

What if, instead of a lanyard, attendees received a bespoke – every one unique – totem? Something lasercut at Belfast’s FabLab? Something that was treasurable, to keep? This might be impractical, but it would be nice to explore what a lanyard – a means of identifying yourself as a part of the conference – could become?



Sponsorship
-----------

I’m delighted to have secured sponsorship from both Shopify and MailChimp. I’ve worked with them in the past and I’m truly honoured that they are backing my vision. I see them as Break’s headline sponsors.

I’d like to involve other sponsors and have ideas around this that I’m currently developing. The team at [Little Thunder](http://littlethunder.co) are heavily involved in Break and will be listed as sponsors, rightly so, for all their hard work and support behind the scenes.



Track Record
------------

As an educator working at The Belfast School of Art for over a decade I have been very proactive in bringing internationally respected speakers to Belfast. I believe an open-minded and inclusive design education – which brings in practicing designers – is critical. Past speakers I have brought to Belfast include:

+ Adrian Shaughnessy (Unit Editions)
+ Andy Stevens (Graphic Thought Facility)
+ Eva-Lotta Lamm (Google)
+ Erik Spiekermann (Edenspiekermann)
+ Nicolas Roope (Hulger)
+ Joe Malia (BERG)
+ Alex Klein (Kano)
+ Jane Fielder (Red Bee Media)
+ Lionel Theodore Dean (FutureFactories)

I hope this document gives a clear sense of what is in my mind. I’m passionate about this and I’m well aware that this will be a considerable undertaking, but I believe it will be worth it.

Please point questions my way – chris@monographic.org – and I’ll do my best to answer them. Thank you.

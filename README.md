Break
=====

In the spirit of transparency I’m opening up my planning process for [Break](http://breakconf.org "Break: A Conference That Questions the Edges of Design"). Certain details – speakers fees and sponsorship agreements are confidential – however, I hope to keep as much as possible in the open.

Once the event is over, I’d like to explore publishing as much detail as I can about the work that goes into running a conference. It’s been an eye-opening experience and it's certainly not the surefire path to riches that many think it is!

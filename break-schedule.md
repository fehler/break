Wednesday, 12 November, 2014 [*](https://github.com/fehler/break/blob/master/wednesday-schedule.md)
----------------------------

This is optional, pre-conference. ‘An Afternoon With Shopify’ is free and, following the success of my collaboration with Shopify at Build in 2013, will follow a similar format. The Shopify event will conclude with an early evening talk, titled ‘A Rather Large Tutorial’. The evening talk is designed to get you asking questions so that your brain is fully engaged for the main conference day.

Wednesday evening’s set aside for dinner (recommendations will follow), followed by informal drinks.


### An Afternoon With Shopify (14.00-17.00)

Venue: The Black Box  
Registration: 13.00-14.00  
Event Begins: 14.00  

Working with Keir Whitaker, of [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com), we’ll once again run ‘An Afternoon with Shopify’ in Belfast. This was a big success when we ran it at Build 2013, and I’d like to build on that success and make it a core part of Break. This year we’ll be running it in The Black Box, one of the principal arts and entertainment venues in Belfast.

In short, we’ll enjoy an informative afternoon of pre-conference education and entertainment, compered by Shopify’s Keir Whitaker. We’ve secured a fantastic lineup of speakers to share their experience with attendees:

+ Elliot Jay Stocks (Creative Director, [Typekit](https://typekit.com))
+ Verne Ho (Director of Design, [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com))
+ Ryan Rumsey (Experience Design, [Nestlé](http://www.nestleinstitutehealthsciences.com))


### A Rather Large Tutorial (17.00-18.00)

Closing the Shopify event in the Black Box, Break organiser Christopher Murphy will give an early evening talk on the theme: ‘What happens when we ‘break’ design?’ This talk asks questions in advance of the following day’s speakers. It seeks to prime the brain beforehand.


### Drinks (20.30-Late…)

We’ll round out the night with drinks designed to continue the conversation. This is informal and will probably congregate around The Duke of York, The John Hewitt and The Dirty Onion.


Thursday, 13 November, 2014 [*](https://github.com/fehler/break/blob/master/thursday-schedule.md)
---------------------------

This is the main event. You could feasibly fly in for it, first thing in the morning, and leave right afterwards, but we’d love it if you could join us for everything. The conference will last the full day and will be followed by a short break for attendees to get dinner. We’ll round out the day with an after-party, generously sponsored by MailChimp.


### Conference (09.30-18.00)

Venue: The Assembly Buildings  
Registration: 08.30-09.30  
Event Begins: 09.30  

Our speakers span a wide spectrum of experience. All, in their own way, are teasing at the edges of design, investigating what it might be and what it might become.

In my mind speakers aren’t ‘web designers’ or ‘graphic designers’ or ‘product designers’ or, indeed, ‘insert-specialism-here designers’. They’re just designers, and even then, I use that term very, very loosely.

Confirmed speakers:

+ Sarah Richards ([Head of Content Design, GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk), [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk))
+ Nicolas Roope ([Hulger](http://www.hulger.com), [Plumen](http://plumen.com))
+ Hamish Muir ([8vo](http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/8vo), [Outcast Editions](http://www.outcasteditions.com))
+ Dan Rubin ([MOO](http://moo.com), [Webgraph](http://danrubin.is))
+ Jane ni Dhulchaointigh ([Sugru](http://sugru.com), [Fail Better](http://sugru.com))
+ Alex Klein ([Kano](http://www.kano.me), [Kano at Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexklein/kano-a-computer-anyone-can-make))
+ Adrian Shaughnessy ([Unit Editions](http://www.uniteditions.com), [Design Observer](http://designobserver.com))
+ Matt Webb ([BERG](http://bergcloud.com), [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/))

I’ve opened out the list of speakers so that they’re challenging and interesting. I think they are all looking beyond the silos of specialism. They will ask participants questions and leave them seeking answers.


### Afterparty (20.30-Late…)

Every conference needs an afterparty and Break is no different. I don’t think an afterparty needs much explanation really: alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic beverages and lots of conversation. We’ve booked [21 Social](http://www.21social.co.uk) for our afterparty. I’m delighted that my friends at [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) are very kindly sponsoring this. I’ve always respected MailChimp’s ethos and I’m very happy to have the on board as sponsors.


Friday, 14 November, 2014
-------------------------

I imagine most people will want to head home on the Friday, but we’re in the process of organising some informal meetups, including a photowalk exploring the city. We’ll publish details as the date approaches.

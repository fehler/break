The Edges of Design
===================


<!--

Kickstarter
-----------

Featuring contributions from Adrian Shaughnessy (Unit Editions), Richard Weston (Ace Jet 170), Jonny Campbell (Brewbot), and others I'll be announcing shortly, The Edges of Design explores where design is and where it is heading. You will receive three DRM-free file formats: ePub, Mobi, and PDF.


Original Proposal
-----------------

I’d like there to be a book of some description, something substantive, with curated content contributed by guest writers (Adrian Shaughnessy, Richard Weston, Jonny Campbell and others…) and edited by Owen Gregory, who edits for Five Simple Steps and 24 Ways.

This could be a sponsored publication, something one off, that gives a different angle on the conference content. It would act as a memento of the event, but would also stand in its own right as a book to return to.

I’d be keen to find a sponsor who would be interested in backing a well-written publication that was properly curated with contributions by respected writers and that was properly edited and beautifully designed. I have a lot of ideas around what this might be, it would be wonderful to push the envelope on this.

By somebody awesome…? In return for a guest pass, perhaps? Think of someone who fits the bill, someone who is breaking down boundaries. Tina Roth Eisenberg?

###The Edges of Design · Christopher Murphy

An introductory text, this follows the format of some of what I've been teaching. Context: Bauhaus; Eames; Droog; etc., etc.. This

<!-- Illustration, Facing Page -->

Dieter Rams’ iconic RT 20 radio is testament to the power of design. Breaking the rules, Rams placed functionality at the heart of his products and through the execution of this precept he transcended preconceived ideas of what these consumer technologies should be. Through training as a carpenter, moving to architecture and finally becoming interested in product design, Rams’ own history and interdisciplinary practice shows how breaking out of the set boundaries of design practice – a notion at the heart of Break – unpicks the hegemony of design dogma.

Our analysis of this object will balance the seminal importance of Braun and Rams' fresh approach, which provides an important historic context for the conference and e-book, with our interdisciplinary interests in the history of science, design and technology. The radio encompasses technological change and visionary design which has had a lasting impact. New transistor technologies in the 1960s facilitated smaller and more portable audio products, and Rams' work has continued to influence prominent contemporary designers.

Consequently we are keen to explore each of these aspects, yet we also wish to address the users and consumers of this product and its wider cultural context. The radio cannot be divorced from the musical revolution of the 1960s or the changing experience of the young, and it would be fascinating to consider the success of this object in relation to the growing competition of colour television and the rapidly expanding consumer electronics market.

Essays
------

Are the essays illustrated? Are they treated in a common manner? How was the NA newspaper done? Look at ads, etc.? Do this? /* Gut reaction: No. */


###Publishing · Adrian Shaughnessy

As we move from a world of atoms to one of bits, one in which we have heard often about both the dematerialisation of design and the end of print (not to mention the challenges content creation is facing), we are seeing a remarkable resurgence in printing.

Perhaps something that explores this. (Perhaps also the challenges of curating? How to pull together a cohesive vision?)


###Finance · Jonny Campbell

Ensure this doesn't tread well-worn ground that's been too heavily trodden. Perhaps explore (as an alternative to crowdfunding, or in addition to crowdfunding) the growing fascination with hardware projects?

Designers, who have been largely working in a digital domain are suddenly exploring physical objects… Again, from bits to atoms.


###Words · Sarah Richards

Take a look at some of Sarah's blog posts, there's definitely something there. Strategy? We'd need to be wary that this isn't a GOV.UK case study, but something about larger changes afoot.


###Branding, Strategy · Richard Weston

Unpack this, perhaps when we have some of the other content pinned down? It might be worth exploring flexible branding systems? Parametric systems? (This might be interesting with Hamish Muir speaking?) It might also be an opportunity to contrast the systems-based rigour of the past with the playfulness of the present?

Look at Universal Everything, Melbourne, etc.?


###Patterns · Josh Long

It would be great to get Josh to write something about education and how education is changing. Perhaps something that draws on his experience at Patterns? The future of education, is it moving away from large, glacier-like institutions towards small, quick-footed alternatives?

What is the place of the studio in education? /* There's a lot of talk about everything moving virtual, I don't think that's wholly beneficial. There is value in community, shared spaces, etc. */ 


###Failure · Jane ni Dhulchaointigh

Might there be something from the Dublin exhibition? /* Also, just one of the women speakers, so it maps onto Adrian. I suspect it would be easier to work with Sarah, and she'd be less busy. */


###The Future of Play? · Another lady?

Toca Boca? Something else? The lady who's doing app camp for girls? Or the lady who spoke at Brooklyn Beta who was super-inspiring. This could take a different look at education that is more play-focused.

Perhaps these should be chronological? I think we need ~20. (Choose a considered number. 20 or 24.)


###Futura

+ Paul Renner
+ 1927

Futura, by Paul Renner, is a geometric sans serif typeface designed in 1927. Its low contrast strokes and efficient geometries epitomise its time, reflecting the aspirations of a machine age, echoed in the name ‘Futura’. With its modern credentials, it’s unsurprising to discover that it served as the Apollo program’s typeface of choice and, to this day, adorns a plaque left on the moon.

A little more here…? What else?

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)



###Barcelona Chair

+ Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
+ 1929

> The Barcelona chair is a chair designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe [and Lilly Reich??] (CHECK THIS.). It was originally designed for the German Pavilion, that country's entry for the International Exposition of 1929, which was hosted by Barcelona, Spain. It was first used in Villa Tugendhat, a masterpiece of Mies van den Rohe in the City of Brno (Czech Republic).



###Polaroid Land Camera

+ Edwin Land
+ 1948?

Stress that camera - in and of itself - is only one half of a complex equation. Of equal importance is the system it inhabits. The camera would be pointless without the complex chemical processes that work their alchemical magic to capture moments of time.

Something about Land also as a visionary…?

> Land Cameras are instant cameras with self-developing film named after their inventor, Edwin Land… The first commercially available model was the Polaroid Land Camera Model 95, which produced prints in about 1 minute and was first sold to the public in November, 1948. Wikipedia.

###Integrated Circuit?

###The Transistor?

###Anglepoise Lamp?



###Boeing 747

+ Joe Sutter
+ 

If we can't get detail on the 747 (dates, etc.) we could use the Mini as an alternative. (Poss. use both?)



###UK Motorway Signage

+ Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert
+ 1957-67



###Mini

+ Alec Issigonis
+ 1959

> The Mini is a small economy car made by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and its successors from 1959 until 2000. The original is considered a British icon of the 1960s.[5][6][7] Its space-saving front-wheel drive layout – allowing 80 percent of the area of the car's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage – influenced a generation of car makers.[8] The vehicle is in some ways considered the British equivalent of its German contemporary the Volkswagen Beetle 




###RT 20 Radio

+ Dieter Rams
+ 1963

This is written in a different tone to the opening piece, it's designed to fit this - different - narrative.




###American Airlines

+ Massimo Vignelli
+ 1967

Lots of great history at [Liquid Brand Exchange][01].

The stylised eagle's interlocking wings, echoing the clean diagonals of Helvetica (the ubiquitous sans).

Designed by Massimo Vignelli in 1967, the American Airlines Corporate Identity stood the test of time for XX years, until it was 'upgraded' by XX in XX. As Vignelli Associates put it, [forthrightly, as is to be expected][02]:

> AmericanAirlines logo half-red, half-blue, in plain type stresses the professional, no-gimmicks attitude of the company in the colours of its home nation. Still in use today, this logo is one of the few worldwide that needs no change.

Mention Helvetica (perhaps also the film?). 

Vignelli on the redesigned logo: "It has no sense of permanence." ([Businessweek][03]) "The logo doesn't need change. It's incredibly important on brand recognition. I will not be here to make a bet, but this [new logo] won't last another 25 years." (Liquid Brand Exchange [01])

###Pac-Man

+ Tōru Iwatani
+ 1980

Text goes here.



###Twitter (Service)

+ Doug Bowman w/ West /* Check this. */
+ 2012

Redesigned in XXXX… Contact Doug Bowman to check this, it'll be good to brush the cobwebs off… Also talk about the iteration of the brand over time. (Perhaps mention the tweet history…?). That said, we're not talking about the brand per se, we're talking about the service, which has - in no small part - been shaped by it's early adopters.

Patterns the company adopted – #hashtags; @replies, /via, /cc; etc. – evolved organically from the community.

What started as a micro-messaging service (once integrated in SMS) has evolved over many years to become a platform for micro-publishing. A little more research on this.




###Kickstarter

+ Perry Chen; Yancey Strickler; and Charles Adler
+ 2009

Seems appropriate to include this? It's a service of a very different kind, but remains a very successful digital product. Contact Charles for some quotes to go with this?




###iPhone 5

+ Jony Ive
+ 2012

More here… processes invented to move the design along. Refer to _Objectified_ for this. (There might also be some other products from that film.)

Acknowledgements
----------------

There will be a large list of folks to thank…

Traditionally acknowledgements would come at the beginning of a book, but I think this should, now, come at the end – in light of some of Craig Mod’s thinking on book structures in the digital age.


----


Colophon
--------

Published using InDesign, Illustrator, etc..

Talk about some of the tools used for the .epub and .mobi files. I suspect this will include the 5SS open source tool, a heads up to Jonathan Snook for his article(s) for 24 Ways and…? Possibly hit up Paulo Raposo for this, too?

The typefaces used in this publication – Elena for body copy, and Klavika for titling – are designed by Nicole Dotin and Eric Olson (respectively) at Process Type Foundry. Elena, “a serif typeface meant for extended reading,” is an exercise in subtlety and restraint. Klavika, “a do-it-all sans serif,” is unadorned, modern and infinitely flexible. Together they make a perfect pairing.

<!--

The grid system and underlying page architecture is an evolution of Bruce Mau’s evolution of Jan Tschichold’s celebrated grid system(s). A combination of Tschichold’s assymetric and symetric thinking with some slight modifications to factor in grid systems in digital media. Like all typography, it’s an evolution.

The structure of the book is important… We’ve put a lot of thought into it. All too often digital books abandon tried-and-tested principles in favour of expedient approaches. We’ve worked hard to combine the best of the old with the best of the new.

As Tschichold put it: “Though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve, have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books, these rules have to be brought back to life and applied.”

Our Speakers
============

Break’s speakers will leave you feeling challenged and invigorated. They’ll inspire you to question your understanding of what design might be if we move beyond the silos of specialism and, instead, embrace the wider continuum of design. We’re delighted to be bringing together eight world class speakers to question ‘the edges of design’.
